                        I've put them into their respective groups above, just click a link to see more.<br>
                        <br>

                        I will avoid talking about major spoilers but there may be <em>minor</em> spoilers like if a character doesn't appear till later in the series or something.

                                    I don't know too much about Doma because he's only had a couple minutes of screen-time in the anime BUT. 
                                    I do know that he is a very dangerous individual. He is second rank in Muzan's group of the most powerful demons and apparently, did <em>something</em> to jump to the second rank quickly.
                                    I'm not sure what that is though... I'm sure he's gonna do something horrible in the next arc and I'll be in pain ( ; ω ; )

                                    Padpa is the second hardest of all the gems but as I said above, they aren't active usually.
                                    Rutile, the doctor of the group, has dedicated a lot of their time to finding a solution to Padpa's condition.
                                    However, Rutile is only ever able to keep Padpa awake for short bursts of time.
                                    We only see them awake once, but in that short amount of time, Padparadscha quickly became one of my favorites.

                                    Annabel Lee will do anything evil or manipulative for the benefit of herself and her love interest, Lenore.
                                    Although, she and the others are competing to get a second chance at life, what's the point if you have to sacrifice your humanity along the way.
                                    She sees the whole thing as a game to be won or lost (which yeah, kinda is). 
                                    I still think she's pretty tho and I like that she's a complex character.

                                    He's kind of an asshole lol (especially to his half brother Yeong-Gi) but in recent chapters he starts learning how to be a decent human being.

                                    Idk how to explain the collective phenomenon that occurred in 2015 when Sans appeared.

                                    <br>
                                    Maru is a tinkerer, part-time nurse, space enjoyer, and lover of nature science. 
                                    She's often found helping her dad with something science-related or building something in her room.
                                    She's really sweet and her family is too. Imo the best bacholerette option in Stardew Valley.
                                    She also gives you bombs sometimes as a gift when you get married. It was so funny the first time that happened to me.

                                    Kotone is <em>the</em> MC of all time. I had a great time playing as her in Persona 3. 
                                    Her friendships and interactions were unique to her experiences which I liked about the game. 
                                    Also you get to learn about Shinjiro, another character I like in P3. 
                                    You don't have him as a social link as Makoto and tbh, I think it's worth it lol.

                                    Aigis is one of my favorite characters in Persona next to Rio, Kotone, and Shinji. 
                                    Aigis is a machine designed to fight against shadows. Of course since she's a robot, she acts like one in the beginning of the game.
                                    But as time goes on, she develops her own humanity through building connections with others.
                                    She deserves the world man. Actually best girl.

                                    She moved from the city to Stardew Valley to live a quieter life. 
                                    She's just a nice character all around. I love the friendship cutscenes she has. They're so nice (´ ω `♡)

                                    In the game, you do tasks / perform rituals to prepare for your date, set up a nice scenery for her, or bring on the end of your universe :D
                                    I really had fun with the game. I definitely recommend playing it if you like monster girls like me o(>ω<)o

                                    There's also some deeper lore about him being used for a sacrifice but it failed so he's like.. some kind of non-human thing with a thirst for blood.
