                    Added some more site buttons.<br>
                    Moved visitor counter and current viewer counter to sidebar.
                    Changed the footer a bit. You can now jump to the top of the page in the footer (except on the home page).
                    Also, I can now update my files from Github :D. I used <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/blog/neocities-automatic-deployment" target="_top">Petrapixel's</a> guide on how to do so.

                    <br>
                    Changed greeting text (more descriptive about the site overall), stamp train to be more in line with the theme.<br>
                    <br>
