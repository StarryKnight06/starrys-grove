                            "Meet Gwendolyn – living proof that princesses don’t always have it all. 
                            See, although she lives in a castle and her father is the King, Gwendolyn isn’t like a movie princess, or even a fairly-tale princess. 
                            She’s got a big heart, but isn’t particularly attractive and doesn’t have a Disney-quality singing voice.<br>
                            <br>
                            But one night, she accidentally stumbles upon the twisted world of the Cursed Princess Club, and her life will never be the same.
                            Hexed and cast out, the ladies of the club are just the people Gwendolyn needs to show her that just because she doesn’t “fit the mold” does not mean she’s any less of a princess."

                            Cursed Princess Club is an oldie but a goodie! 
                            The first chapter released in 2019 and it just recently wrapped up earlier this year.<br>
                            <br>
                            The story was very impactful and I *really* felt for the characters when they were going through it. This is a story of learning self-love, the importance of family, and acceptance.<br>
                            <br>
                            I have definitely cried a couple times reading this ( ˘•̥ _•̥ ˘ )<br>
                            If comedy, then why tears? ( ˘•̥ _•̥ ˘ )

                            Daybreak is a romance slice of life featuring Cog and Marcus. You follow their day to day life from school and onto college and you see their relationship grow over time.
                            It's not happy go lucky *all the time*, but I enjoy reading about Marcus' and Cog's cute moments together.<br>
                            <br>
                            Also, I <em>LOVE</em> the art style so much. Moosopp draws the most stylish outfits, they're always so cute :3

                            One of my favorite horror webtoons! The story is really interesting, grim reapers are their own species and they run a funeral service. 
                            Then the MC is just a guy (lmao) who unfortunatly get's wrapped up in all of the chaos.
                            Actually the chaos is largely HIS fault but yknow. Nobody's perfect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Puppetology does something really cool with their art style in that when Felix (the MC), is or isn't high on something, you can tell by the artstyle and the colors.
                            Early on in the story, everything is sickeningly bright / semi-neon because bro is high off his rocker lol (´ ∀ ` *)<br>
                            I won't say what happens when he sobers up (eventually), you'll just have to see :)

                            I guess I should have seen it coming seeing who her family is tbh. I guess I wasn't really surprised maybe more like OH OKAY. Moving along then.<br>

                            Aside from that nonsense, I love the essense powers the characters have in this world! Essense's have different colors and they all mean / do different things.
                            How Aberrants are treated also feels like if they were to exist, this would probably happen.

                            I really love the story / world building in this webtoon. 
                            The MC's past is shrouded in mystery and we see her essentially rebuild herself from the ground up in the apocalyptic world.<br>
                            <br>
                            There are these creatures called Murks that will completely take over your body if you look at them and sooner or later, the host will die if it doesn't feed on human flesh.
                            Often times the "infected" are no longer their previous self and is now just goes around feeding on people.<br>
                            <br>
                            However, there are some exeptions like our MC here, Rayne. Rayne and her murk have created a mutual relationship, even though she lost her memories as a result of being infected, they both work togther to try and survive.
                            She also meets other survivors who become allies, and even someone who knew Rayne before she became infected. <br>
                            <br>
                            It's a really good read. It's definitely in my top 5 for thriller webtoons (⌒ω⌒)

                            Imagine missing the bus on the first day of school and deciding to hide it from your family and you end up going down this path of adventure and tragedy.
                            Yeah this is what this webtoon is about. <br>
                            <br>
                            These twins, Dani and Dorian, are the children of one of the most powerful witch families and are very gifted.
                            The life their parents had planned for them starts to fall apart once they miss their first day of school. 
                            They end up taking an apprenticeship with the local hermit wizard and end up getting involved in dark things they weren't supposed to.<br>
                            <br>
                            It was such a lovely read. We get to see Dani and Dorian grow up and all their experiences as well. 
                            It also has such a beautiful ending.
                            You also get to see the author's art style develop over time because this webtoon started in <em>*looks at my notes*</em> 2015 and ended in 2020!

                            He knows her favorite color, favorite food, favorite place to eat, and so much other stuff. 
                            But, as creepy as this sounds, he still tries to watch from a distance and protect her whenever she's in trouble.
                            He has dedicated his whole life to protecting Dajeong and learning everything there is to know about her. <br>
                            <br>
                            Truths begin to be revealed when he discovers her being attacked late at night and he has to step in to save her. 
                            She wanted to know who he was but he ended up running away.
                            Later on in the story, there's this <em>crazy twist</em> that happens that puts his actions and this whole story in a whole different perspective!<br>
                            <br>
                            Writing this is making me wanna reread it again ( ´ ▽ ` )<br>

                            Victor accepts, hoping to get the job done quickly, only to find himself magically entangled with the bride and groom and caught in the middle of more romance than he knows what to do with."

                            As you read in the lil synopsis there, Victor was tasked with bringing Enrique's wife, Mercedes back to life after she got poisoned days before her wedding day.
                            The ritual to bring her back to life ends up going wrong because he didn't have the full instructions.
                            This resulted in her lifeforce being bound to Victor's and they can't be to far from each other because of this reason.<br>
                            <br>
                            Also her memories were wiped as well.<br>
                            <br>
                            So they all band together to recover Mercedes' memories and try to escape the city. There's also some romance here n there in the beginning but becomes really important later on in the story :)

                            This webtoon is the literal opposite of doomed yuri (hopefull yuri???) Malori and Velverosa are so cute together ( ˘͈ ᵕ ˘͈♡)<br>
                            <br>
                            I love reading about Malori's shenanigans. 
                            But MAN the world building / lore building in this story is great! 
                            You really start to get a feel for the kingdom like it's a real place.<br>
                            <br>
                            Oh and we actually get to see the MC have *character development* and actually learn from her mistakes or short comings :D 
                            (sorry i binged the first season of Re:Zero and *tried* to watch season 2. I'm still kinda salty that Subaru didn't really change at all man. It was like he was back at square one (¬_¬)

                            Easier said than done when Davina’s first client is a dangerously compelling Venetian underboss who’s determined to get under her skin. 
                            What he wants from her, she can’t imagine, but Gabriel Angelini drags her back into the glittering world of organized crime she thought she’d left behind forever. 
                            She might get answers about her past if she digs deep enough, but can she protect Mikey from his father’s ambitions and keep her heart from getting tangled up in their treacherous web?"

                            Another BANGER of a webtoon. I know the genre is romance but it's more like a romance / action! 
                            Davina is a trained super nanny who was tasked to protect Gabriel's son Mikey who just so happens to be a part of a mafia family.<br>
                            <br>
                            Davina tried to not get involved in their family matters but she has not choice when Mikey's safety comes into concern.
                            Eventually, she ends up helping and getting closer to Gabriel as a result. 
                            But she also realizes that things may not be what they seem in the Angelini family.<br>
                            <br>
                            The family as a whole reeks of distrust, lies, and deceite. So it's up to her and Gabriel to work together to protect themselves and the ones they hold close.<br>

                            Mundt's artstyle is beautiful and has edges and curves all in the right places 	( ´ ∀ `)ノ～ ♡<br>
                            <br>
                            The colors are BOLD when they need to be or downed out if need be.
                            I love the MC's red hair too. So pretty (´｡• ᵕ •｡`)<br>
                            <br>
                            Really good story telling too! I like the concepts of the different powers each group has.

                            <strong>My ramblings:</strong>
                            Stagtown was SUCH a fun read. I really like a lot thriller / horror comics and this one is definitely in my top 3.
                            The suspense and plot twists (oh boy the *plot twists*) had me hooked on the story.<br>
                            <br>
                            The characters are written very well too! They all feel like real people in this crazy situation.
                            Punko's use of color is also something of note.
                            A lot of the colors in the background, characters, etc are some variation of black, grey, or white.<br>
                            So when she uses some pops of color, you know something is about to go down.
