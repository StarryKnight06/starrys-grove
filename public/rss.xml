                ☘ Finally finished the webtoon reviews in the library&#x3C;br&#x3E;
                &#x3C;br&#x3E;
                Hii I'm back coding again :D I made an RSS feed so ppl who want to keep up with site updates can! It's really useful so you don't have to make a neocities account to stay updated. I think everyone should make one =w= Anyway, I used &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://doqmeat.com/notebook/tutorials/rss/#setup&#x22;&#x3E; Doqmeat&#x27;s guide&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on how to make an RSS feed. It was really easy to understand :3
